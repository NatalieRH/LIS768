# About Me

## Natalie Hagopian

I am a second-year MLIS student at the iSchool. I am from Madison, WI. In the iSchool, I'm focusing on academic libraries, and I hope to continue working in academic libraries following my graduation in May. I currently work at two academic libraries, both at the UW. I am a reference assistant at [College Library] (https://www.library.wisc.edu/college/) and the PA librarian at the [Center for Limnology] (https://limnology.wisc.edu/). 

Some of my favorite things about working in academic libraries include:

- helping students learn about conducting college level research
- finding out about the interesting projects students and faculty are working on
- providing reference service, especially when I get weird questions! 

### Interests in LIS 768

I came into this class knowing almost nothing about digital humanities, so I'm excited to see how my interests evolve. I am interested in learning Python, and just generally becoming more confident with coding and other technology tools. Over the course of this program, I've discovered that I really enjoy learning these things, but hadn't had any experience in this area prior to starting graduate school.
